# C++ Planetary Position Tracker (Developed with AI Assistance)

This project is being developed with the assistance of Gemini, a large language model from Google AI. Gemini's capabilities are used to explore and understand astronomical concepts, aiding in the creation of this C++ planetary position tracker.

**Project Description:**

This project aims to develop a C++ program capable of calculating and tracking the positions of planets within our solar system. The core functionalities will rely on astronomical principles, particularly Kepler's Laws of planetary motion.

**Programming Language:**

C++ is the chosen language for this project due to its efficiency and suitability for scientific calculations.

**Goals:**

* **Accurate Planetary Tracking:** The primary goal is to achieve a high degree of accuracy in calculating planetary positions based on their celestial mechanics.
* **Reaching a Wide Audience:** We hope this project gains recognition and becomes a valuable tool for astronomy enthusiasts and anyone interested in tracking planetary movements.

**Conclusion:**

This C++ planetary position tracker is under development, and we welcome your interest and potential contributions. As the project progresses, we'll update the code and functionalities on this repository.
